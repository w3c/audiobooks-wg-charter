				<h2>Success Criteria</h2>

				<p>In order to update the Recommendation, each substantive change is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a>.</p>
				<p>
					Each substantive change should contain a section detailing all known <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#security-privacy">security</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/#security-privacy">privacy</a> implications for implementers, authors, and end users.
				</p>
				<p>
					To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.

				<h2>Coordination</h2>
				
				<aside class='comment'>The CG URL below may have to be updated at the time of finalizing the charter.</aside>
				<p>
					This group is expected to coordinate with the <a href='https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/'>Publishing Community Group</a> on consensus-based proposals related to content changes for the Audiobooks Working Group Deliverables. The Chairs of this group may choose to reject proposals that are incompatible with this Charter. 
				</p>

        		<p>
					For all substantive change, this Working Group Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition. The Working Group Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of each specification. The Working Group Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
				</p>

        		<p>
					Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:

					Participation
				</h2>
				<p>
					To be successful, this Working Group Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
					W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
				</p>
			</section>


			<section id="communication">
				<h2>
					Communication
				</h2>
				<p id="public">
					Technical discussions for this Working Group Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository and may permit direct public contribution requests.
					The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
				</p>
				<p>
					Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/publ-wg/">Audiobooks Working Group home page.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Most Audiobooks Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
				</p>
				<p>
					This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Apubl-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories">GitHub issues</a>. The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.
				</p>
			</section>



			<section id="decisions">
				<h2>
				Decision Policy
				</h2>
				<p>
					This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
				<p>
					However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
				</p>
				<p>
					To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group Group.
				</p>
				<p>
					All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
				</p>
				<p>
					This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
